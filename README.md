# BACK-END:

The RideSharing contract is a Solidity smart contract designed to facilitate transactions for a ride-sharing application on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract is deployed on the blockchain and runs on a network of computers, allowing users to interact with it via the application interface.

The contract includes various functions for creating, updating, and cancelling ride requests and also provide unique tokens for the passengers aswell as the drivers for secure transactions. For example, users can create a new ride request by specifying the pickup and destination locations, as well as the maximum number of passengers. The contract stores this information and makes it available to other users who are looking for a ride.

The driver's in the proximity of the passenger put forward different rates which can be selected by the passenger.

Once a ride request is created, other users can search for available rides and offer to become the driver. The contract provides features for verifying the driver's identity and for handling payments between the driver and rider.

When a ride is completed, the contract can handle feedback between the driver and rider, allowing them to rate each other based on the quality of the ride. The contract also includes safety features, such as limiting the maximum number of passengers and verifying driver and rider ratings, to ensure a safe and secure ride-sharing experience.

In addition, the RideSharing contract is designed to be deployed to the Ethereum mainnet or testnets using a tool like Hardhat. This allows developers to test and deploy the contract in a secure and decentralized environment, without relying on centralized third-party services.

Overall, the RideSharing contract provides a secure and decentralized platform for ride-sharing transactions on the blockchain, allowing users to easily create and manage ride requests, as well as handle payments and feedback between drivers and riders.
